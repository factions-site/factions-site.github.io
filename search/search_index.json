A faction can claim territory , work together to build a base , and build (or destroy) relationships with other factions. Territory \u00b6 Land control in Factions is per chunk In Minecraft, a \"chunk\" is a 3D piece of the Minecraft world. It goes from the bedrock all the way into the sky (y) and is 16 blocks by 16 blocks in the horizontal dimensions (x and z). A faction claims land by chunk, dependent on how much power they possess at a rate of 1 chunk per power or at a set amount per faction member when in DTR mode. Within its territory, members of the faction can exclusively build without interference of non-members (configurable through the /f perms command). Your faction's territory is where you can build your base, set your faction's home location, create warp points, and more. Claiming territory is performed with the /f claim command. Tip Want to see the boundaries of the chunk in which you're standing? Use the /f seechunk command! Power \u00b6 Every player has a quantity of \"power.\" A new player typically starts with 0 power and slowly gains power over time by playing on the server. Dying takes a way a set amount of power. When a player is part of a faction, their faction's power is calculated as a total of its players' power. Power is how factions acquire territory, or raid another faction. A faction can claim territory as long as its power is greater than its current territory claims. If, through player death or players leaving a faction, territory count is greater than power the faction can be raided by enemies who can now destroy blocks in their enemy's territory and maybe even claim territory away from the faction. DTR \u00b6 An alternative to power, Deaths 'til Raidable is a mode in which land claiming does not depend on power but instead factions can claim a certain amount based on faction membership. Every time a faction member dies, the faction's DTR value decreases (typically by 1) and once it hits 0 the faction's land can be raided and looted.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#introduction-to-factions","text":"","title":"Introduction to Factions"},{"location":"introduction/#what-is-a-faction","text":"It's a group of players, like a team or a club.

Click here You can control who, inside or outside your faction, has access to various actions within your territory. How it all works: Selectors and Actions \u00b6 Determination of who can perform what actions is sorted out by selectors , which then have defined for them a series of allowed or denied actions . For example, a selector may describe all members of the faction with at least the moderator role, and that selector is allowed the setwarp action, so they may set warps within the faction. Or, perhaps a selector describing allies of the faction is allowed to open doors within the faction, as this faction wants their allies to enter their territory. To determine if a player can perform an action, the selectors for a given faction are checked in order . If a player matches a selector, the matched selector is then checked for the action. If the action is found then that state, allow or deny, is used. Only the first selector-matched action state (allow/deny) is used. For anyone familiar with Discord permissions, this system behaves similarly. If no selectors match, or the action is not present in any matching selectors, the action is denied. Server admins can control override permissions, defining selectors and actions that will apply to all factions and will be processed before any faction-set selectors are checked. As an example usage, a server admin could force all factions to allow allies to use buttons through an ally matching override selector with button set to allow. In the config, admins can additionally set actions to hidden and this will prevent the action from showing up anywhere. It is not advisable to hide an action after the server has been running without also setting an all override selector for it to avoid any previously set options from being unchangeable by faction admins. All of this functionality can be controlled by a faction leader through the /f perms command, just by running that base command and clicking the text within to add/remove/reorder selectors.

For example, a selector may describe all members of the faction with at least the moderator role, and that selector is allowed the setwarp action, so they may set warps within the faction. Or, perhaps a selector describing allies of the faction is allowed to open doors within the faction, as this faction wants their allies to enter their territory. To determine if a player can perform an action, the selectors for a given faction are checked in order . If a player matches a selector, the matched selector is then checked for the action. If the action is found then that state, allow or deny, is used. Only the first selector-matched action state (allow/deny) is used.

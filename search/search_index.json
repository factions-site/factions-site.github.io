Or, perhaps  a selector describing allies of the faction is allowed to open doors within the faction, as this faction wants their  allies to enter their territory. </p> <p>To determine if a player can perform an action, the selectors for a given faction are checked in order. If a player  matches a selector, the matched selector is then checked for the action. If the action is found then that state,  allow or deny, is used. Only the first selector-matched action state (allow/deny) is used. For anyone familiar with  Discord permissions, this system behaves similarly. If no selectors match, or the action is not present in any matching  selectors, the action is denied.</p> <p>Server admins can control override permissions, defining selectors and actions that will apply to all factions and  will be processed before any faction-set selectors are checked. As an example usage, a server admin could force all  factions to allow allies to use buttons through an ally matching override selector with <code>button</code> set to allow. In the  config, admins can additionally set actions to hidden and this will prevent the action from showing up anywhere. It  is not advisable to hide an action after the server has been running without also setting an <code>all</code> override selector for  it to avoid any previously set options from being unchangeable by faction admins.</p> <p>All of this functionality can be controlled by a faction leader through the <code>/f set perm</code> command, just by running that  base command and clicking the text within to add/remove/reorder selectors.</p>"},{"location":"permissions/#actions","title":"Actions","text":"Action Description ban Can ban others from the faction build Can build in faction territory (while not raidable) button Use buttons in faction territory (while not raidable) container Use containers in faction territory (while not raidable) destroy Can destroy in faction territory (while not raidable) disband Can disband the faction (careful!) door Use doors in faction territory (while not raidable) economy Can access faction economy fly Can fly in faction territory frost Can frost walk in faction territory (while not raidable) home Can visit the faction home invite Able to invite others to the faction item Use items in faction territory (while not raidable) kick Can kick faction members lever Use levers in faction territory (while not raidable) pain Allows building/destroying in faction territory but causes pain (while not raidable) plate Can interact with pressure plates promote Can promote members up to their own role within the faction sethome Can set the faction home setwarp Can set a faction warp shield Can deploy the faction shield territory Can claim/unclaim faction territory tntdeposit Can deposit into faction TNT bank (including siphon) tntwithdraw Can withdraw from faction TNT bank (including fill) upgrade Can purchase faction upgrades warp Can use faction warps zone Can control faction zones"},{"location":"permissions/#selectors","title":"Selectors","text":"<p>Any selector that can match a faction (all, faction, relation) can be used for non-player actions like pistons</p> Selector Description all Matches everything, always. faction Matches a specific faction.
